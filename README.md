Note: This project is still working in process. 


In this project, I want to build an event sign up form, which can be used for social events, like birthday party, graduation celebration, and wedding reception etc. In this form, guests fill up their basic personal information and dietary preferences. As a result, this form helps the host know more about guests in order to plan a good event. For instance, how many tables to arrange, how much food to order, and what kind of food to prepare.


This project requires both front end and back end. In the front end, I use HTML, JavaScript and CSS to build website structure and styling. In the back end, I use Rust for server computation and communication.
